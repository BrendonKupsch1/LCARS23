Brendon Kupsch's notes:
=======================
My brother Evan Kupsch helped me with memeory and pcb implementation, and with difficult errors that I was stuck on.
Using GitHub Copilot to help write this code.
 https://copilot.github.com/ 

 Copilot notes:
    Copilot will begin brackets but rarely predicts closing brackets, leading to some annoying formatting problems that need to be manually fixed. This gets very annoying with complicated code because copilot messes up on the end of most functions.

    Copilot is extremely helpful for commenting code. It does a very good job at reading your code and creating a comment very close to what I would write myself.
     After using GitHub Copilot for some time, it is worth the price of admission for commenting alone. I save so much time not having to write comments myself.
    Copilot is also very good at basic functions like the operational codes. I think this is becasue it has a large database of OS students who wrote similar code.

    Copilot did a great job with initDisplays and updateDisplays functiosn in control.ts.
